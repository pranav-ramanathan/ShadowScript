# ShadowScript

ShadowScript is a project that includes several Python scripts demonstrating various data structures and a simple lexer.

## Files in this project

### stack.py
This script implements a basic stack data structure. Stacks are a type of data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.

### binary_tree.py
This script implements a binary tree data structure. Binary trees are hierarchical structures with a parent node and at most two children nodes (left and right).

### lexer.py
This script implements a basic lexer (also known as a tokenizer). The lexer takes a string of code as input and breaks it up into tokens, which are categorically defined chunks of the code.

### shell.py
This script is a shell interface for interacting with the lexer. It allows the user to input a string of code and see the resulting tokens.
